Multiple reputable news sources and the project's public statements indicate the WIF team operates as volunteer/pseudonymous organisers rather than a formal corporate entity; fundraiser controllers have been reported as named influencers (Ansem/Zion Thomas, Mihir, Edward, Quasi) and funds sit in a multisig wallet. Because no verified company registration, registration number, or legal address was found on official project pages or filings, all issuer fields are set to 'Unknown' and issuer.status='Unknown'. Evidence links are to news coverage and the exchange listing that reference the project and organisers."
